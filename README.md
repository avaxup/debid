**DEBID**

Create Your Decentralized Auction Protocols with Debid Debid fully decentralized.. Create auctions without central authority sitting between bidders and seller.

Debid is a Decentralized Bidding Protocol built for Avalanche and Ethereum assets with low transaction fees and a democratic distribution.
Debid protocol has been developed with fully decentralized smart contracts. It is not subordinate to a central authority; there is no intermediary company or person, only sellers and buyers. Debid has been developed using the solidity programming language. All flows work autonomously, running under the control of smart contracts.Users can offer their digital assets to auction by tokenizing (NFT) with Debid. The user who makes the highest bid as a result of the auction becomes the owner of the digital asset (NFT). This whole process can be followed transparently on the blockchain network, is closed to manipulation and is very fast.

With the digitalizing world, physical products started to take their place in the digital world. The products that took their place in the digital world brought ownership and transfer problems with them. At this point, blockchain technology has brought very effective solutions to ownership and transparent transfer problems. Transparently transferring digital product ownership from one side to the other without the problem of trust has become the most important point. With the recent popularization of the NFT concept, unique digital products have been created. Ownership of these unique products was transferred on blockchain networks.

Debid offers a transparent and reliable protocol to all its users by using blockchain technology and smart contracts. Creating a decentralized platform for users and collectors with unique products in the digital world and ensuring that the entire process is carried out autonomously is the biggest goal of Debid.
